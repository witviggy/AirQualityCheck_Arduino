# AirQualityCheck_Arduino
This is my first project - Air Quality Monitoring and Alert System, which I built in my 2nd semester of my Undergrad. Though simple I still remember those chucklesome moments confusing the circuit connections and blowing out the new ardUNO board. 
1) It is a Beginner level arduino project.
2) Here we interface multiple sensors to a common microcontroller and network through SPI protocol.

* Objective:
   To give an alert signal if the AQI value monitored from surrounding exceeds the threshold value.
* Components Used:
  1) Arduino UNO
  2) MQ135 sensor
  3) MQ4 sensor
  4) MQ3 sensor
  5) DHT sensor
  6) Buzzer module
  7) 16x4 LCD display
  8) M-M & M-F wires
* Program:
  The code for the project is attached in the next file.
* Result:
  The output will be displayed in the LCD display along with the AQI index.
